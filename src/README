# `src/` Folder

This folder contains the main code for the **ESP32 Pet Feeder** project.

## Main Files
- **`main.cpp`**: This is the main entry point of the system, where the logic is implemented. It handles:
  - Connecting to Wi-Fi
  - Setting up the MQTT connection
  - Controlling the servo motor to dispense food
  - Taking a photo using the ESP32 camera and sending it via Telegram

## Key Functions
- **setup()**: Initializes all components (Wi-Fi, MQTT, servo motor, camera).
- **loop()**: Main loop that processes MQTT commands and triggers feeding.
- **feed()**: Controls the servo motor to open and close the feeder door.
- **sendPhoto()**: Captures and sends a photo of the bowl to Telegram.

## How to Use
1. **Set up your Wi-Fi credentials** in `config.h`.
2. **Upload the code** to the ESP32 using PlatformIO.
3. **Trigger feeding** via the button, MQTT command, or automatically every 3 hours.

## Extending the Project
- To add new features, modify the `main.cpp` file or add new modules in the `lib/` folder.
- You can integrate more sensors or create a user-friendly interface.
